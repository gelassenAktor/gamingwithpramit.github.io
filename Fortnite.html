<p1 style = "font-size: 30px">Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking is a must in order to survive. <br>There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite. If you want to play Fortnite, you must install the Epic Games Launcher which you can install from the table on the end of this page. You can play with other people. There are many Seasons where you have to play and it will always change. You can install Fortnite in the website from Epic Games: https://www.epicgames.com/site/de/home?sessionInvalidated=true".</p1>
